OpenBSD's ksh for Gentoo/Ragnarok
=================================

Portable OpenBSD `ksh(1)`. Soft-fork of [OKSH](https://github.com/ibara/oksh/).
Not an official OpenBSD project.

Why?
----
Because all operating systems deserve a good shell.

Unlike other ports of OpenBSD ksh, this port is entirely self-contained and aims to be maximally portable across operating systems and C compilers.
We are always looking for new combinations to add support for.

License
-------
The main Korn shell files are public domain (see `LEGAL`).
Portability files are BSD or ISC licensed; see individual file headers
for details.
